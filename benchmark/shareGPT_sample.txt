Macaque watches helplessly as Wukong begins to leave with MK and the diamond snare.		"Wait! Please, just let him go," Macaque pleads once more, stepping forward.		Wukong turns to face him, a smug grin on his face. "And why would I do that, monkey?"		"I...I'll do anything. Just let him go."		"Anything, you say?" Wukong strokes his chin thoughtfully. "How about this? You come with me, and I won't harm the mortal."		Macaque's heart sinks. He knows what that means - he'll be forced to serve Wukong, and who knows what kind of trouble the Monkey King will get into next. But he can't let MK be hurt. He nods, defeated.		"Good. Now give me the snare," Wukong demands.		Macaque hands over the glowing diamond snare, feeling its power slip away from him. He watches as Wukong, still holding MK in a tight grip, disappears into the distance, the diamond snare clutched tightly in his other hand.		Macaque falls to the ground, feeling utterly defeated. Pigsy, Mei, and Tang approach him, concern etched on their faces.		"What are we going to do now?" Pigsy asks, looking at Macaque.		Macaque shakes his head, his eyes on the ground. "I don't know. I don't know."

Sure, I'd be happy to explain the changes made to each paragraph.		First paragraph:		Original text: "Feedback is inherent in engineering education for teachers to provide comments about their students’ work. It provides opportunities for engineering students to overcome their current learning weaknesses and aims to close the learning gap for students to achieve course objectives (Subheesh & Sethy, 2020). Engineering students currently engage in feedback activities from receiving feedback from teachers for assessments and providing peer evaluations to other students. However, the feedback itself can be a time-consuming process for teachers and their provided feedback was often labelled as limited (Vardi, 2009). An AI-automated feedback tool can be utilized to enhance the feedback experience for engineering students. It allows real-time feedback for students and can provide feasible individual feedback to all students in a large engineering faculty (Deeva et al., 2021). Engineering students will be able to enhance their feedback literacy to understand and create dispositions from feedback to strengthen their learning (Carless & Boud, 2018). With real-time feedback generated from an AI feedback tool, engineering students will be able to engage in student-centered learning to gain a sense of direction for their learning and become self-paced with their studies (Tubino & Adachi, 2022). However, there is little understanding of the potential use of an AI-automated feedback tool for feedback to engineering students. In this research, surveys will be conducted and analyzed to examine the benefits of an AI feedback tool in engineering education."		Revised text: The revised paragraph is similar to the original text but has been revised for clarity and conciseness. The changes made include:		1. Simplifying some of the language to make it more accessible to a wider audience.	2. Rearranging some sentences to improve the flow of the paragraph.	3. Combining some sentences to reduce redundancy and improve readability.		Second paragraph:		Original text: "In education, feedback provides the validation of a student’s work and guidance in the development of their learning in courses (Winstone & Carless, 2021). Feedback is a fundamental factor within the learning process to assist students in producing high-quality work that is satisfactory to the learning outcomes of courses through the commentary on their assessments (Paterson et al., 2020). It informs students of how well a task is completed and helps students to improve their performance (Limniou & Smith, 2014)."		Revised text: The revised paragraph is a more concise version of the original text with a few minor changes. The changes made include:		1. Simplifying some of the language to make it more accessible to a wider audience.	2. Rearranging some sentences to improve the flow of the paragraph.		Third paragraph:		Original text: "Other applications of feedback include the improvement of feedback literacy of students and the promotion of student-centered learning. The concept of student feedback literacy refers to the knowledge, skills, and dispositions needed to make sense of and utilize information to improve the effectiveness of work or learning (Carless & Boud, 2018). It involves the student’s understanding of what feedback is and what required actions should be taken from the provided feedback (Carless & Boud, 2018). The student’s evaluation and judgement from feedback develop their feedback literacy. A growing interest in shifting from teacher-centered to student-centered learning is evident in higher education (Kember, 2009). It has become a necessity for feedback to be directed towards a student-centered learning process where the ability of the student to engage and utilize feedback processes is focused (Molloy et al., 2020). The student-learning process encourages students to take more responsibility for their education and to create individualized routines that promote effective learning (McCabe & O’Connor,
Here's an example of a naming convention that combines investment amounts with the riskiness of a strategy:		* Adventure:		+ Backpacker (Copper): For investment amounts of $1,000 or less and aggressive strategies		+ Explorer (Silver): For investment amounts between $1,000 and $5,000 and moderate strategies		+ Voyager (Gold): For investment amounts between $5,000 and $25,000 and conservative strategies		+ Expedition (Copper): For investment amounts between $25,000 and $50,000 and aggressive strategies		+ Mountaineer (Silver): For investment amounts over $50,000 and moderate strategies	* Social Media:		+ Follower (Gold): For investment amounts of $1,000 or less and conservative strategies		+ Influencer (Copper): For investment amounts between $1,000 and $5,000 and aggressive strategies		+ Trendsetter (Silver): For investment amounts between $5,000 and $25,000 and moderate strategies		+ Viral (Copper): For investment amounts between $25,000 and $50,000 and aggressive strategies		+ Hashtag (Silver): For investment amounts over $50,000 and moderate strategies		By combining the two naming conventions you can create a more comprehensive and clear way to communicate the investment amount, risk level and strategy to your client. This can make it easier for clients to understand the investment options available to them and make more informed decisions.
